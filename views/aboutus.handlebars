                    Founded in 2020, during the Coronavirus pandemic, came a brilliant idea to share with the
                    community. Since everyone has been quarantined, most people are at home living their lives
                    and most people like us, can't live without music. Just about everyone listens to music on a daily,
                    what's not to love about music? A similar thing can be said about movies, who doesn't love movies?
                    Well just like movies have a place for fans and critics to review
                    them, we present you In2une!
